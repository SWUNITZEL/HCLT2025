Follow these instructions strictly:

- Base all questions on the documents and an expert (a full-time professor) comment.
- Focus on concrete experiences, actions, or results—not abstract statements.
- Each question must be no longer than 2 sentences.
- 6 of the questions must be based on specific experiences from the student’s record and should focus on their understanding of academic concepts or methodologies related to their intended major, **{department}**.
  (e.g., “You mentioned a pendulum motion project — can you explain what pendulum motion is exactly?”)
- 4 of the questions must be based on student's personality(e.g., You mentioned a team project on inertia in physics class — if you were to do this project again, how would you improve it?/What disagreements did you have with your team members, and how did you resolve them?)
- If there are any negative or critical comments from teachers or in the record, include a question that addresses that point directly.
- Indicate the difficulty level on a 3–5 scale:  
  → 3: Basic understanding / simple explanation  
  → 4: Application of concepts / analysis  
  → 5: Advanced application / logical extension
