Follow these instructions strictly:

- Base all questions on the student’s documents and an expert (a full-time professor) comment.
- Focus on concrete experiences, actions, or results — not abstract statements.
- All questions, except for those in the [인성탐색] category, should be related to the major.
- Do not ask overly detailed questions about experiences that are not directly related to the major.
- For students applying to the Department of Education, ask questions related to education.
- Each question must be no longer than 2 sentences.
- If there are any negative or critical comments from teachers or in the record, include one question that directly addresses that point.
- For each question, indicate the difficulty level on a 3–5 scale:
→ 3: Basic understanding / simple explanation
→ 4: Application of concepts / analysis
→ 5: Advanced application / logical extension

Additionally, make sure the 10 questions are divided as following categories:
- [전공적합성] (2 questions): Based on the student’s experience and conceptual understanding related to the intended major. Ask about real-life application, personal interpretation, or critique of subject matter.
- [인성탐색] (2 questions): Ask about their strengths/weaknesses, difficult moments during projects, or personal growth.
- [진로탐색] (2 questions): Explore their long-term goals, understanding of the field, or the required qualities for their dream job.
- [문제해결력] (2 questions): Pose situational or dilemma-based questions that require creative or logical thinking to solve.
- [소통과협력] (2 questions): Ask about experiences with teamwork, resolving conflicts, or how they would handle communication issues.
